title: "First Hackathon Experience: Introducing Green Room Radio"

Yesterday, I went to my first Hackathon: the AT&T Mobile App Hackathon in
Boston. It was a very fun event (thanks to the organizers) that I recommend to
every people interested in new technologies, being a developer or not.

My team was composed of Alki (from [wattnow][2]), Ming and Charles. Here was our
idea. Living in big cities, many gigs happen every night, mostly with local
bands you're not familiar with. Exploring the local scene is an exciting
adventure but it requires a lot of work and can be time-consuming. What if an
app could automatically create and play a playlist of the bands playing in your
neighborhood tonight? We worked on that app. We called it Green Room Radio.

## Geolocation + Songkick + Bandcamp

Technically speaking, we created a native iOS app, running on iPad, iPhone and
iPod Touch executing the following tasks:

- geolocation of the user
- fetching of JSON data of all concerts near the user position from the
  [Songkick API][3]Â (thanks to Sabrina for providing us an API key so quickly on
  a saturday)
- fetching of JSON data from the artists playing from the [Bandcamp API][5]
- highlighting artists know from Bandcamp for which a track was available to be
  streamed

We started from scratch, wrote the first line of code at 1.30pm and by 7pm, were
ready for our demo of a functional-but-ugly app. Here areÂ some screenshots:

## What happens next?

Of course, the app needs some design work. Then we'd love to get some feedback
from Songkick and Bandcamp. Eventually, we could add many new features:
integrating other services, featuring social sharing options, providing links to
purchase concert tickets or purchase music, etc.

And as we love the name "Green Room Radio", we're also aware that it might be
pretty misleading for people who don't know what a [green room][6] is (I was
part of them) so we might have to find a new name for it.

Hopefully, the app will end up on the App Store but in the meantime, if you want
to try this app, have some feedback to share, or a name suggestion, feel free to
contact me.
